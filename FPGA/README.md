# Vivado setup
Use Xilinx Vivado to create a vivado project in this directory.
Name the project "vivado_project", this will make git ignore the project folder, and only update sources and block designs.

Make sure that when you create a new ip/block design, that the file location is the sources or block_design directory. 

Any .bit in this folder are tested binaries ready to be transfered onto the PYNQ-Z2 board
