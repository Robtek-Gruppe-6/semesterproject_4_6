# Control of Pan Tilt System Group 6 (4) ROBTEK Semester 4 SDU
The goal is to control a Pan-Tilt System using an FPGA and a Microcontroller to track heat/IR from an IR emitting moving object.

## FPGA
To program on the FPGA, go to the FPGA folder and check the READ.md file there.

## Microcontroller
Information about the microcontroller goes here.
